## Dataset Det

   Pine wood and rubber wood are two common woods in wood industry, 

and they have different color and texture characteristics, we have established 

two defect datasets based on our captured pine images and rubber images 

with the resolution of 658×492 from these two woods. The pine lumber dataset 

main includes 2686 annotated images with three typical defects: DK, SK and ME, 

and the rubber lumber dataset includes 1362 annotated images with five typical 

defects: DK, SK, ME, TC and CK. Fig.2 shows some defect images for these two datasets
